# Hi there, I’m rajat

I’m learning Android development and exploring AI — just for fun and growth. I build open-source Android apps, aiming for clean, maintainable code and continuous learning.  
I previously worked in web development (AEM); now I’m shifting my focus to Android and mobile-first ideas.
Now I am making Open Apps - Bunch of open source , useful apps.

## 📂 Projects  
| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Jotter** | Simple open-source notes app (Android) — my first mobile app project |

> “Every line of code is a step forward in my learning journey. (Probably)”
